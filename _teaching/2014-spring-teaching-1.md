I taught three courses in-person, hybrid, and virtually concurrently at Mascoma Valley Regional High School, including Honors Biology, General Education Biology, and a senior seminar in Environmental Science. Additionally, I co-created the school-wide Social-Emotional Learning curriculum.

Honors Biology
======
My honors biology course adapted the [University of Colorado Inquiry Hub](https://www.colorado.edu/program/inquiryhub/curricula/inquiryhub-biology) curriculum for hybrid and virtual learning, and included a unit on biochemistry and molecular biology through infectious diseases and vaccines that culminated in a formal research poster presentation; a unit on Duchene's Muscular Dystrophy that taught genetics and heredity; a unit on populations and ecosystems, and a final unit on plant biology.

General Education Biology
======
My general education biology course explored biology first through the lens of different types of plants and animal body systems to build science fluency and math and English skills-- culminating in an in-depth research project on a particular animal-- as well as shorter versions of the Honors Biology units.

Environmental Science
======
My environmental science course literally investigated the interaction of humans and the environment from the ground up-- first learning about basic geology, natural cycles, and the weather, then the Green Revolution and agriculture, and finally transportation and energy.
