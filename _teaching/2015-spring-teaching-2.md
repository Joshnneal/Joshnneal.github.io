While an undergraduate student, I was an 8th grade City Year Boston AmeriCorps member at the William B. Rogers middle school in the Hyde Park neighborhood of Boston. I additionally was a teaching assistant for a 7th grade summer school program at the John W. McCormack middle school. After recieving my bachelors degree, I additionally taught two years of middle school science: first, as an 8th grade science teacher with Teach for America AmeriCorps member at Neighborhood House Charter School in the Dorchester neighborhood of Boston, and later as a 6th to 8th grade science teacher at Hartford Memorial Middle School in Hartford, VT. 

City Year Boston
======

[City Year Boston](https://www.cityyear.org/boston/) is an organization that sends AmeriCorps service members into Boston Public Schools to partner with teachers in providing academic, social-emotional, and attendance support to students. As an 8th grade Corps Member, I learned, above all, about the importance of education equity; as well as the hollistic approach to education, including building relationships and explicitly teaching social problem solving and emotional regulation skills as a part of teaching middle school students.

Neighborhood House Charter School
======

I was a founding educator at the new Neighborhood House Charter School High School in 2017, and taught 8th-grade science, as well as an elective course in Japanese language.

Hartford Memorial Middle School
======

I taught 6th, 7th, and 8th grade science, as well as elective courses in Japanese Language and technology, and coached rock climbing. The end of the year was taught virtually due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
