At the PSC, graduate students provide evidence-based individual, couple, family, and group therapies to both children and adults, and are supervised by a licensed clinical psychologist. We also provide mental health information consultations to outside groups. For more information, visit the PSC website: https://psyc.vt.edu/centers/psychological-services.html
