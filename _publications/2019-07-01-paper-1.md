Abstract: Exposure to salinity causes plants to trigger transcriptional induction of a particular set of genes for initiating
salinity-stress responses. Recent transcriptome analyses reveal that expression of a population of salinity-inducible genes
also exhibits circadian rhythms. However, since the analyses were performed independently from those with salinity
stress, it is unclear whether the observed circadian rhythms simply represent their basal expression levels independently
from their induction by salinity, or these rhythms demonstrate the function of the circadian clock to actively limit the
timing of occurrence of the salinity induction to particular times in the day. Here, by using tomato, we demonstrate that
salt inducibility in expression of particular salinity-stress related genes is temporally controlled in the day. Occurrence of
salinity induction in expression of SlSOS2 and P5CS, encoding a sodium/hydrogen antiporter and an enzyme for proline
biosynthesis, is limited specifically to the morning, whereas that of SlDREB2, which encodes a transcription factor involved
in tomato responses to several abiotic stresses such as salinity and drought, is restricted specifically to the evening. Our
findings not only demonstrate potential importance in further investigating the basis and significance of circadian gated
salinity stress responses under fluctuating day/night conditions, but also provide the potential to exploit an effective way for
improving performance of salinity resistance in tomato.
