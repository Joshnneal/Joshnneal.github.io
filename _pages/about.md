Thanks for visiting my website!
---

I am a graduate student researcher in [Brooks King-Casas](https://fbri.vtc.vt.edu/people-directory/primary-faculty/king-casas.html) and [Pearl Chiu](https://fbri.vtc.vt.edu/people-directory/primary-faculty/chiu.html)'s labs in the [Computational Psychiatry Unit](https://fbri.vtc.vt.edu/research/research-centers/center-for-human-neuroscience/computational-psychiatry-unit.html) at [Fralin Biomedical Research Institute of Virginia Tech Carillion](https://fbri.vtc.vt.edu/). 

Our labs are at the intersection of computer science, neuroscience, clinical psychology, and economics; we design studies that investigate social interactions, psychopathology, and response to treatment using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and microeconomic games. A great open access recent example of our lab's work is this paper on [reinforcement learning in depression.](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/article-abstract/2782452)

Talks
---
My research focuses on interpersonal interactions in Veterans with PTSD, using economic games and fMRI, and while I haven't published on it (yet), you can learn a little about it under the [Talks](https://kelsey-winkeler.github.io/talks/) tab. 

Publications
---
Before my PhD, I collaborated on a few interesting studies involving various combiations of plants, genetics, and volatile metablomics, which you can read about in my [Publications](https://kelsey-winkeler.github.io/publications/) tab.

Clinical Portfolio
---
I am also a clinical psychology PhD student at the [Psychological Services Center](https://support.psyc.vt.edu/centers/psc) of Virginia Tech. Generally, I am a CBT-trained graduate clinician supervised by PhD-level licensed clinical psychologists, and emphasize creating a safe and supportive environment, especially for sexuality-and-gender minoritized people. I have specialized in treatment of child and adolescent trauma, anxiety and mood disorders, as well as adult and child autism, ADHD, and mood/anxiety disorder assessments. For more information about the services Virginia Tech offers, check out the [Clinical Portfolio](https://kelsey-winkeler.github.io/portfolio/) tab.

Teaching
---
Previously, I was an [AmeriCorps](https://americorps.gov/serve) member and a middle and high school science teacher, and I care deeply about education. You can read about my teaching experience under "Teaching". 

In my free time, I also still provide mentoring and outreach to undergraduates at my alma mater, the College of Wooster, via the [Fighting Scots Career Connections](https://wooster.firsthand.co/) website, as well as a handful of high school students. If you're not a Wooster alum and would like advice about grad school, being a first-generation college student, or anything else, feel free to send me an email, and we can set up a time to chat.

Other Pursuits

If you'd like to learn a little about me outside of school, you can check out the [Other Pursuits](https://kelsey-winkeler.github.io/outside-of-school/) page. Note: Other Pursuits page is currently under construction (9/23/22).
