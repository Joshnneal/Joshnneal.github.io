Thanks for visiting my website!

I am a clinical science student in the [ANDLab](https://fbri.vtc.vt.edu/people-directory/primary-faculty/king-casas.html) in the Psychology Department in [Virginia Tech](https://psyc.vt.edu/). 

Our lab operates at the intersection of biological, developmental, and clinical psychology; we design studies that investigate social interactions, psychopathology, and response to treatment using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and microeconomic games.

Clinical Portfolio

I am also a clinical psychology PhD student at the [Psychological Services Center](https://support.psyc.vt.edu/centers/psc) of Virginia Tech. Generally, I am a CBT-trained graduate clinician supervised by PhD-level licensed clinical psychologists, and emphasize creating a safe and supportive environment, especially for sexuality-and-gender minoritized people. I have specialized in treatment of child and adolescent ADHD as well as trauma, anxiety and mood disorders. I additionally regularly perform adult and child autism and ADHD assessments. For more information about the services Virginia Tech offers, check out the [Clinical Portfolio](https://joshnneal.github.io/portfolio/) tab.

Teaching

In my free time, I also still provide mentoring and outreach to undergraduates at my alma mater, the College of Wooster, via the [Fighting Scots Career Connections](https://wooster.firsthand.co/) website, as well as a handful of high school students. If you're not a Wooster alum and would like advice about grad school, being a first-generation college student, or anything else, feel free to send me an email, and we can set up a time to chat.
