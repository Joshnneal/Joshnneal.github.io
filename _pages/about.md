Thanks for visiting my website! I am a graduate student researcher in Brooks King-Casas and Pearl Chiu's labs in the Computational Psychiatry Unit at Fralin Biomedical Research Institute of Virginia Tech Carillion. My research focuses on interpersonal interactions in Veterans with PTSD, using economic games and fMRI, and while I haven't published on it (yet), you can learn a little about it under the "Talks" tab. 

Before my PhD, I collaborated on a few interesting studies involving various combiations of plants, genetics, and volatile metablomics, which you can read about in my "Publications" tab.

I am also a clinical psychology PhD student at the [Psychological Services Center](https://support.psyc.vt.edu/centers/psc) of Virginia Tech. If you want to learn about my clinical experience and expertise, check out the "Portfolio" tab.

Finally, I previously was an [AmeriCorps](https://americorps.gov/serve) member and a middle and high school science teacher, and I care deeply about education. You can read about my teaching experience under "Teaching". 

In my free time, I also still provide mentoring and outreach to undergraduates at my alma mater, the College of Wooster, via the [Fighting Scots Career Connections](https://wooster.firsthand.co/) website, as well as a handful of high school students. If you're not a Wooster alum and would like advice about grad school, being a first-generation college student, or anything else, feel free to send me an email, and we can set up a time to chat.
