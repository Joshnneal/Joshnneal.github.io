Thanks for visiting my website!

I am a graduate student researcher in Brooks King-Casas and Pearl Chiu's labs in the [Computational Psychiatry Unit](https://fbri.vtc.vt.edu/research/research-centers/center-for-human-neuroscience/computational-psychiatry-unit.html) at [Fralin Biomedical Research Institute of Virginia Tech Carillion](https://fbri.vtc.vt.edu/). 

Talks
---
My research focuses on interpersonal interactions in Veterans with PTSD, using economic games and fMRI, and while I haven't published on it (yet), you can learn a little about it under the [Talks](https://kelsey-winkeler.github.io/talks/) tab. 

Publications
---
Before my PhD, I collaborated on a few interesting studies involving various combiations of plants, genetics, and volatile metablomics, which you can read about in my [Publications](https://kelsey-winkeler.github.io/publications/) tab.

Portfolio
---
I am also a clinical psychology PhD student at the [Psychological Services Center](https://support.psyc.vt.edu/centers/psc) of Virginia Tech. If you want to learn about my clinical experience and expertise, check out the [Portfolio](https://kelsey-winkeler.github.io/portfolio/) tab.

Teaching
---
Previously, I was an [AmeriCorps](https://americorps.gov/serve) member and a middle and high school science teacher, and I care deeply about education. You can read about my teaching experience under "Teaching". 

In my free time, I also still provide mentoring and outreach to undergraduates at my alma mater, the College of Wooster, via the [Fighting Scots Career Connections](https://wooster.firsthand.co/) website, as well as a handful of high school students. If you're not a Wooster alum and would like advice about grad school, being a first-generation college student, or anything else, feel free to send me an email, and we can set up a time to chat.
